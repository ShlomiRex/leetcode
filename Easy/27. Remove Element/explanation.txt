We use two pointers.
One pointer 'i' points to the first number that is equal to 'val'.
The second pointer 'j' increments until it finds a number that is not equal to 'val'.
Then we swap the two numbers, and increment both pointers.

The return value is amount of numbers that are not equal to 'val'. i.e. the pointer 'i' which is the beginning of the 'val' numbers.

We also in the process shift the array, such that all 'val' numbers are at the end of the array.

Time complexity: O(n)
Memory complexity: O(1)
